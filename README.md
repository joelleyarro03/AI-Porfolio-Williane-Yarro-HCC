‚úÖ Applied AI Portfolio ‚Äì Technical Skills & Step-by-Step Setup
üéØ Objective

To develop a professional GitHub portfolio that showcases proficiency in the concepts and tools acquired through the Applied AI and Robotics program,
making it appropriate for job applications, internships, or further academic pursuits.

üîß STEP-BY-STEP: Demonstration of Technical Skills
1Ô∏è‚É£ Establish a Functional GitHub Repository
Skills Utilized:
‚Ä¢ Creation of GitHub repositories
‚Ä¢ Version control through Git

Steps:
‚Ä¢ Logged into GitHub and selected New Repository.
‚Ä¢ Employed a professional naming convention, such as,
applied-ai-portfolio-[FirstName][LastName]
‚Ä¢ Opted for "Public" visibility (or private with access provided to instructors).
‚Ä¢ Included:
o A README.md file to outline the project.
o A .gitignore file to omit temporary and environment files.
o Chose a license if necessary (e.g., MIT).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Structure the Folder Organization
Skills Utilized:
‚Ä¢ Structuring projects and documentations

Steps:
Developed a tidy, professional structure:
applied-ai-portfolio/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
